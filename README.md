# Movie Correlation

## Introduction
This data analytics project involved exploring movie data using Python to identify correlations between different variables such as gross revenue, company, budget, and votes. The data was sourced from this [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielgrijalvas/movies) scraped from IMDb.

## Objective
The objective was to gain insights into which factors contribute the most to a movie's financial success.

## Conclusion
The data showed that votes and budget had the highest correlation with gross revenue, indicating that these factors were significant contributors to a movie's financial success. On the other hand, the company had a relatively low correlation, suggesting that it had less impact on the financial success of a movie. 

These insights could be used by filmmakers, producers, and investors to make more informed decisions when creating, financing, and distributing movies.
